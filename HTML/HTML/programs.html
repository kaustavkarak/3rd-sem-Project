                </li>
                <p>There are many goals you achieve through resistance training with weights in the form rep and set
                    schemes along with the percentages of your 1Rm (1 rep max) that you are lifting.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hypertrophy:</b> Enlargement muscles by increasing size of cells in muscle fiber.</li>
                    <li><b>Muscular endurance:</b> Ability of muscles to exert tension over a long period of time.</li>
                    <li><b>Muscular strength:</b> The amount of force a muscle exerts in a single maximum effort.</li>

                    <h3><b>Flexibility Training</b></h3>
                </li>
                <p>Flexibility is more than being able to touch your toes, it’s about general musculoskeletal health.
                    Exercises that facilitate flexibility and mobility, like stretching
                    are often neglected or deemed as ‘not proper’ exercise, as exertion seems minimal at first glance.
                    Disregarding this kind of training from your regular routine is
                    actually doing you a disservice as compromised mobility can limit your range of motion, and stunt
                    your fitness goals, or in the worst case can lead to injury down the line.

                </li>
                <p>
                    Every stretch can be either static or dynamic and passive or active. Dynamic and active stretches
                    are more helpful for improving functional movements used in everyday
                    life and sports.

                <p>
                    A proper diet is needed to maintain in reccomendation of a Nutritionist to get the best result to
                    achieve your goal out of your exercise and staying healthy.

                    <h3><b>Yoga</b></h3>
                </li>
                <p>These days yoga boasts as many styles of the practice as there are ranges of activewear brands.
                    Hatha, Ashtanga, Iyengar, hot yoga, vinyasa flow, Kundalini
                    and yin are a few of the most commonly known ones.</p>

                </li>
                <p>With a whole fitness industry built on goal-oriented workouts tailored to individuals looking to lose
                    weight, get healthy or lean — the simple act of
                    playing a sport can often be overlooked. As a genuinely holistic and above all fun form of exercise,
                    sports can go a long way in motivating and keeping
                    you physically active, especially later in life. Team sports like hockey, basketball and soccer are
                    amazing outlets that balance quality high-intensity
                    training while throwing a ton of fun and a social element into the mix.</p>

                    <h3><b>Pilates</b></h3>
                </li>
                <p>this method of exercise incorporates controlled movements with an emphasis on alignment, breathing
                    and building the core—referred to by Pilates
                    instructors as the “Powerhouse”. Over time Pilates will not only increase flexibility but help
                    improve coordination, balance and all-round stability.

                    <h3><b>Mobility work</b></h3>
                </li>
                <p>
                    If you’re looking to release tight, sore muscles after a killer workout, then you may want to check
                    out foam rolling. This form of mobility work,
                    along with other devices like lacrosse balls for trigger points, are an indispensable part of any
                    regular workout regime. Foam rolling offers
                    deep tissue release and can be done pre-workout to warm muscles up or post-workout to alleviate
                    tension.
